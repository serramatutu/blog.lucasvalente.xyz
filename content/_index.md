Welcome, stranger.

This is my ever-growing collection of thoughts and reflections. Please, make yourself comfortable, brew some tea :tea: and feel free to explore.

Here you might find:
- My attempts at making "art": songs I made :cd:, pictures I took :camera:, pixel art :paintbrush:
- Posts about computer science, programming and self-hosting :computer:
- Reports on my cooking experiments :cook:
- Some reflections about my career as a Software Engineer so far :brain:
- And more!

I hope you like it!
